  abstract: "A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were—and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. \_Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science."

  abstract: >-
    The Common Law is Oliver Wendell Holmes' most sustained work of
    jurisprudence. In it the careful reader will discern traces of his later
    thought as found in both his legal opinions and other writings. At the
    outset of The Common Law Holmes posits that he is concerned with
    establishing that the common law can meet the changing needs of society
    while preserving continuity with the past. A common law judge must be
    creative, both in determining society's current needs and in discerning how
    best to address these needs in a way that is continuous with past judicial
    decisions. In this way, the law evolves by moving out of its past, adapting
    to the needs of the present, and establishing a direction for the future. To
    Holmes' way of thinking, this approach is superior to imposing order in
    accordance with a philosophical position or theory because the law would
    thereby lose the flexibility it requires in responding to the needs and
    demands of disputing parties as well as society as a whole.
