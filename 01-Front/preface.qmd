# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book presents material for use in a first-year law school Civil Procedure course. Topics covered include the scope of a lawsuit (Party & Claim Joinder), selection of an appropriate forum (Personal & Subject Matter Jurisdiction), presentation of claims and defenses (Pleadings), choice of applicable law (the _Erie_ doctrine & the Rules Enabling Act), disposition without a trial (Summary Judgment), and the effect of judgments on future litigation (Claim & Issue Preclusion).

Most of the materials reproduced here are in the public domain; excerpts from copyrighted materials are included for teaching purposes under the fair use doctrine. Materials have been redacted to omit passages not pertinent to the learning objectives. Judicial opinions have also been "cleaned up" for ease of reading.[^Preface1] 

[^Preface1]: _See_ [@Metzler2017] (proposing "cleaned up" parenthetical for quotations from judicial opinions, to indicate the author “has removed extraneous, non-substantive material like brackets, quotation marks, ellipses, footnote reference numbers, and internal citations; may have changed capitalization without using brackets to indicate that change; and affirmatively represents that the alterations were made solely to enhance readability and that the quotation otherwise faithfully reproduces the quoted text.”)

[Sidenotes & Margin Notes]{.preface-h3}

Following the style of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), this book uses sidenotes and margin notes in place of traditional footnotes or endnotes. These appear in the right-hand margin, avoiding the need to jump through hyperlinks or scroll to the note text:

- Numbered sidenotes[^sidenote] are used for footnotes (with original source material note numbers indicated in parentheses). 
- Unnumbered margin notes [This is an example of a margin note.]{.aside} ([green sans-serif typeface]{.margin-note}) are used for editor's comments within cases and other source material. 

[^sidenote]: This is an example of a sidenote. 

[Links]{.preface-h3}

Links to external material are indicated by [dark red]{.link-color} text, e.g. [Mayo v. Satan, 54 F.R.D. 282 (W.D. Pa. 1971)](../exhibits/Mayo_Satan.pdf).
